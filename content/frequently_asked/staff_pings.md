## Staff Roles
A â€œping" or a "tag" is where you mention a member (e.g. <@&815615864539185183> ) or role. 
This notifies that user or every user with that role so generally speaking:
1. Pinging one or two moderators for help is NOT a bad thing.
2. Pinging the entire staff team for no reason is wasting all of our time, and will result in a mute.

The role/s are pingable for emergencies only and not for you to get attention.

## Emergency examples:
1. Raids / Multiple members mass spamming.
2. Anything that requires more than 2 Moderators to handle.
3. Extreme disruption of the Discord ToS. (NSFW content inside non-NSFW marked channels)
