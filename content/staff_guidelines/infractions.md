Everyone here is about having a fun time. But rule breaks are going to happen. 
Generally speaking, members who are found to be in violation of the rules may be disciplined in one of the following methods, in order of severity:

## Verbal Warning: 
Staff will ping the individual who has broken the rule and remind them kindly to keep the rules in mind. This is often for minor infractions.
