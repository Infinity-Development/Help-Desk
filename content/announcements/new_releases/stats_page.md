## About this Update
We have added the Stats Page for all of our Users who are curious about
how many bots we have Approved, Denied ETC as well as some information
about the website itself such as Ping and Uptime.

Along with this stats page we have released a similar page for the
Infinity Bot List API which can be found [here](https://api.infinitybotlist.com/stats)
