1.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: This is the main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins you‚Äôd like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

2.  **`content/articles`**: This is the folder where you'll place your articles.

3.  **`data/collections.yml`**: This file defines the collections of your help center. Each article will belong to one collection. A collection consists of many articles. A collection can have different sections which its articles may belong to.

4.  **`data/authors.yml`**: This file is where you'll list your authors. Every author needs an id, a name and an avatar. You can add an author to each article.

5.  **`data/avatars`**: Place the author's avatars in this folder and use them in `authors.yml`.
