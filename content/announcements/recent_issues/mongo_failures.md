description: "Updates and Info about our recent Database Issues"
---

During the duration of the past few weeks we have been having a variety of DB Issues.
these issues seemed to cause bots to be randomly deleted from our Database after being approved

We have taken the steps necessary and worked closely with a few of the Mongo Support Members
to get this issues resolved in a timely fashion without causing a Major Downtime for our services

After completing a variety of updates, Checking and fixing incompatible code, Replacing needed scripts
and components and a extensive list of other debug methods we are finally pleased to announce that these
issues seem to be resolved.

Our Dev Team will continue to monitor the results of our fixes and will keep everyone updated should anymore
issues decide to present themselves.
