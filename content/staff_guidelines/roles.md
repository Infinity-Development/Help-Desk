Server Roles are broken up into the following categories:

* **Vanity Roles**: These roles don't provide any special rights/privileges except to make certain information easy to see when clicking on a user's profile.
* **Prescriptive Roles**:  These roles will provide special rights/privileges server-wide, category-wide, or channel specific.
