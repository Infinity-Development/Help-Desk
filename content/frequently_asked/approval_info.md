At Infinity Bot List we like to prioritize our Bot Queue and how long a bot remains in queue.
Sometimes maintaining the consistency that we would like to see is not as simple as it sounds!

Below you will be able to find all the answers to any questions you may have regarding our queue
and approval process.

## Queue Page
Our website houses a public queue page that serves to show all Bot Devs some information they may
find helpful. This info includes: Ordered List of Bots in Queue, Number of Bots we have Approved etc.

You can access our Queue Page [here](https://infinitybots.gg/queue)

## Approval Time
We try to approve bots in the order which they were added. 
``At most your bot should be in Queue for no longer then 1 week.``
You should also receive a DM from our official Bot (<code style="color: #7289DA">Infinity Bot List#6706</code>) letting you know if your bot was approved or denied.

## What we look for!
1. Online and Responsive during time of testing
2. Majority of the provided Commands or Features work as expected
3. Informative Long Description providing users Precise info on using your bot
